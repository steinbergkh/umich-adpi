            <h2>Welcome to the Beta Eta Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi at the University of Michigan!</h2>

            <p>
                My name is Maddy and I am President of the Beta Eta chapter of Alpha Delta Pi.
                I’m so proud to lead this group of incredible group of women who never fail to make
                me smile and inspire me to be a better student and sister every day!
            </p>

            <p>
                Our open motto, "We Live for Each Other", represents the strong sisterhood shared by every
                member of our sorority. Michigan is a large university and it can be intimidating at first,
                but I was able to find my home in ADPi with sisters who support me in everything I take on.
                I initially joined a sorority for a way to get involved in college, but it quickly became
                evident that the bonds that tie my sisters and I together will last far beyond our four
                years at Michigan.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Alpha Delta Pi, not only have I had a blast at sisterhood events, Alpha Delta Picnic,
                football games, and date parties; but I have learned how to be a better leader, a more organized
                student, and a dependable friend. I have learned countless lessons through my experience in
                Alpha Delta Pi that I never would have anywhere else on campus. ADPi has enriched my college
                experience and will continue to enrich the rest of my life. I am proud to be a member of Alpha
                Delta Pi forever and always.
