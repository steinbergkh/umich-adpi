            <h2>Welcome to the Beta Eta Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi at the University of Michigan!</h2>

            <p>
                The women of Alpha Delta PI are a talented and diverse group of women who have been making
                their mark on Michigan's campus for over 80 years. Our time-honored traditions of striving
                for excellence and giving back to the community allow us to get involved, get a great education,
                and have fun during our years here at Michigan.
            </p>

            <p>
                ADPi's open motto: "We Live for Each Other" truly represents the strong sisterhood encompassed by our
                sorority.
                At such a large university, it is important to find a smaller community of people who support you.
                "Going Greek" at U of M is a great way to make friends and get involved. I have made some of my best
                friends within the Greek system and the bonds that tie my sisters in ADPi and I together will last a
                lifetime.
                Whenever I meet a Beta Eta alum, there is an instant connection because of our membership in ADPi.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our chapter is full of diverse and genuine women who have so much to offer by ways of support and
                knowledge.
                Alpha Delta Pi has given me life-long friendships as well as taught me lessons on how to be a better
                leader,
                a more dependable friend, a more organized student, and maintain philanthropic values.
                The experiences gained at Alpha Delta Pi cannot be replicated anywhere else on campus. I am proud to be
                a
                member of Alpha Delta Pi forever and always.
