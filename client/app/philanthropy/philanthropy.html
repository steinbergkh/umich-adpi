        <p>
            Alpha Delta Pi's national philanthropy is the Ronald McDonald House.

        <p>
            Throughout the year, we raise money and volunteer making dinners for the families
            staying at Ann Arbor's local Ronald McDonald House. We do so by hosting Mr. Greek Week
            Greek Week and throwing our annual fundraiser, ADPicnic in the spring.

            The Ronald McDonald House is a place where families from all over the country
            can come and stay so that they can be near their children while they are being
            treated at the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. The Ronald McDonald House has
            accommodated about 600 families per year since its opening in 1985. In 2011,
            another Ronald McDonald House was opened within the hospital which accommodates
            an additional 12 families per night.
